# Release Notes - v1.5.1

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Fixed MCP Connection Hanging Issues
- **Problem**: MCP server would get stuck showing "HTTP ‚úì MCP ‚úó" and require multiple disconnect/reconnect cycles
- **Solution**: Implemented proper cleanup and state management for smooth connections

### Key Improvements:
1. **Added `/disconnect` endpoint** - Properly cleans up all pending requests when plugin disconnects
2. **Improved connection state tracking** - Both plugin and MCP activity monitored with timeouts
3. **Fixed pending state display** - Now correctly shows "HTTP: ... MCP: ..." during connection attempts
4. **Smooth reconnection** - No more hanging or stuck states when reconnecting

## üß™ Testing Framework Added
- Comprehensive Jest test suite for TypeScript
- Unit tests for all critical components
- Integration tests for connection flows
- Test runner scripts for easy testing
