**Connect AI assistants like Claude to your Roblox Studio projects**

*20+ tools for project analysis, script editing, and bulk operations*

</div>

---

## What is This?

An MCP server that lets AI assistants read and modify your Roblox Studio projects. Claude can now explore your game structure, read scripts, and make changes directly through Studio.

**What it does:**
- Project analysis - Browse your entire game structure
- Script editing - Read and modify script source code  
- Mass operations - Change hundreds of objects at once
- Search tools - Find anything in your project quickly
- Local processing - Everything runs on your machine

---

## Quick Setup

**Step 1:** Install the Studio plugin from the [Creator Store](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/75577477776988)

**Step 2:** Enable "Allow HTTP Requests" in Game Settings → Security

**Step 3:** Connect your AI assistant:

```bash
# Claude Code
claude mcp add robloxstudio -- npx -y robloxstudio-mcp

# Claude Desktop - add to config
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "robloxstudio-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "robloxstudio-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

That's it! The plugin shows "Connected" when ready.

## What Can You Do?

**Project Understanding**
```
"What's the structure of this game?"
"Find all scripts that handle player data"
"Show me every RemoteEvent in the project"
```

**Debugging**
```
"Find potential memory leaks in my scripts"
"Which parts might be causing performance issues?"
"Are there any deprecated API calls?"
```

**Mass Operations**
```
"Make all checkpoint parts non-collidable and transparent"
"Create 50 test NPCs positioned in a grid"
"Update all GUI themes to use the new color scheme"
```

**Script Work**
```
"Explain how this weapon system works"
"Add error handling to this script"
"Optimize this movement code"
```
